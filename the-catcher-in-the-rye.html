          <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>
        </h1>
          <p id="intro">
           J. D. Salinger’s fictive character Holden Caulfield 
            has become “an icon for teenage rebellion and angst” and is considered “among the most important characters of 20th-century American literature,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Caulfield">according to Wikipedia</a>.
          </p>

        <p>Why? Let’s see how he was created.</p>

            <img src="images/holden-caulfield.jpg" alt="holden-caulfield"/>
            
            
             <aside>Holden Caulfield. Little, Brown and Company&reg;.
            
          </aside>

        <p>
           But first, a very short summary of <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>:</span></p>
          
          <p>
            17-year-old Holden Caulfield details two days of his life from when he was 16. He’s expelled from prep. school; and being young, confused and curious, he heads to New York in search of truth. He reflects, comments, and rants about the different situations he encounters during these two days. </p> <p>The story ends with Holden promising his ten-year-old sister, Phoebe, he in fact <em>won&rsquo;t</em> leave her and the family, after just earlier having told her he would.
        </p>

        <p>
          This shows Holden&rsquo;s growth. Throughout the story, he’s bitter and cynical to everything and everyone. But in the end, he realizes that he
          misses many of his earlier acquaintances, including Ackley and Stradlater (his roommates) and Mr. Antolini (his teacher).
        </p>

        
        
        <p>
          Storywise, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> is thus a <em>coming-of-age</em> novel. It depicts Holden&rsquo;s experiences and growth from the age of 16 to 17.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a cynical character</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the novel, Holden describes his experiences, relations, and thoughts with distinctively <em>judgmental</em> language and phrases. This is apparent with particularly three phrases: &ldquo;That killed me,&rdquo; &ldquo;I really was,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If you want to know the truth.&rdquo;</p>
              
              <p>
                These three phrases appear constantly throughout the novel:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>He said the play <em>itself</em> was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts,
          of course, were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake. <em>Angels</em>.
          That killed me. &hellip; I was all set to puke when it was time to go
          sit down again. I really was.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          &ldquo;That killed me&rdquo; and &ldquo;I really was&rdquo; allow the
          author to further describe Holden&rsquo;s feelings and thoughts.
          Salinger presents the reader with a <em>hyperbole</em>&mdash;in this
          case, &ldquo;I was all set to puke.&rdquo; He then expands on this
          literary device by adding &ldquo;I really was.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
          killed me&rdquo; has the same effect, as it too underscores Holden&rsquo;s views. (Yet it is, uniquely, also a hyperbole in and of
          itself.) </p>
          
          <p>These phrases therefore augment the author&rsquo;s
          hyperboles. In turn, these hyperboles describe Holden by demonstrating his thoughts and reactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;If you want to know the truth,&rdquo; on the other hand, shows
          Holden being judgmental to <em>himself</em>, as opposed to his
          surroundings. This is especially obvious in chapter 13: &ldquo;If you
          want to know the truth, I&rsquo;m a virgin. I really am&rdquo;.</p>
          
          <p>
              The passage reveals that the
              character is ashamed of his virginity, as Holden says, &ldquo;If you
              want to know,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;If you actually want to
              know&mdash;because this is embarrassing.&rdquo; Thus, this phrase
          depicts Holden&rsquo;s self-bitterness and insecurity.
        </p>

        <!--<div class="article-box">

          <ol>
            <li>Exaggerated, judgmental phrases show Holden&rsquo;s thoughts and
            responses to his surroundings.</li> <li>Repeating said phrases reveals just how
            bitter the character really is. It also renders the novel more
            subjective, and thus coming-of-age.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>-->

        <h2>Creating a subjective story</h2>
        <p>
          There’s more to analyze from chapter 17’s excerpt: &ldquo;He said the
          play <em>itself</em> was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts, of course,
          were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake.
          <em>Angels</em>.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          First: Salinger <em>italicizes</em> words. Reading the excerpt, we
          naturally put emphasis on <em>itself</em> and <em>angels</em>, as type
          set in italic (or bold) <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/color.html">contrasts regular roman letters</a>.</p>
          
          <p>We’ll call this <em>visual emphasis</em>, as opposed to emphasis
          achieved through clever wording (i.e., figures of speech & literary
          devices). Because for further emphasis, Salinger combines these two approaches.</p>
          <p>Particularly obvious is his heavy use of <em>repetition</em> and <em>periods</em>:
          &ldquo;[They] were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake.
          <em>Angels</em>.&rdquo; In this tiny eight-word snippet,
          Salinger has put four periods. This “forces” us to read slower, 
          with more emphasis allotted to each word. The result? We get to truly
          <em>feel</em> Holden’s hostility toward the label
          <span class="smcp">Angels.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, Salinger frequently uses <em>contractions</em> and
          <em>swearing</em>. The former concerns replacements like
          <em>shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve</em> and <em>wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve</em> in
          place of “should not have” and “would not have.” The latter
          concerns phrases like “For Chrissake.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Contractions and swearing are a casual, verbal way of self-expression
          (though swearing to a much higher degree) that give the reader the
          impression that Holden is <em>telling</em> a story, as opposed to just
          reporting past events. This accentuates the fact that
          <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> is
          <span class=>Holden&rsquo;s</strong> story&mdash;told subjectively and casually.
        </p>

        <!--<div class="article-box">
          <h3>takeaway</h3>
          <p>
            Salinger uses an unconventional style of writing for emphasis as well as to
            render his story verbal and subjective. The stylistic choices are both visual (setting type in italic) and literary (the use of repetition, full stops, contractions,
            and swearing).
          </p>
        </div>-->

        <h2>Depicting subjective interpretations</h2>
        <p>
          The word <em>buzz</em>&mdash;as in the phrase &ldquo;To give someone a
          buzz&rdquo;&mdash;appears repeatedly throughout <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>.
          <em>Buzz</em> is <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english-thesaurus/phone"> slang for “phone call,”</a> and often
          serves to naturally progress the story&mdash;a way for Holden to
          encounter other characters.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>It does, however, also trigger inner monologues:</p>

        <blockquote>
         
          <p>
          While I was changing my shirt, I damn near gave my kid sister Phoebe a
          buzz, though. &hellip; Somebody with sense and all. But I
          couldn&rsquo;t take a chance on giving her a buzz, because she was
          only a little kid and she wouldn&rsquo;t have been up, let alone
          anywhere near the phone. I thought of maybe hanging up if my parents
          answered, but that wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve worked, either.
          They&rsquo;d known it was me. My mother always knows it&rsquo;s me.
          She&rsquo;s psychic. But I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have minded
          shooting the crap with old Phoebe for a while.
          </p>
         
          </blockquote>

        <p>
          Holden&rsquo;s relation to his sister as well as his mother are
          revealed. His sister is &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;; his mother is a
          &ldquo;psychic.&rdquo;&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to demonstrating character relations, this inner monologue
          augments future events by building <em>suspense</em> and enabling
          <em>foreshadowing</em>. Throughout Holden&rsquo;s trip in New York, we
          anticipate his eventual encounter with his family (i.e., his mother).
          Yet this never happens, which, due to the suspense and foreshadowing,
          confuses and surprises us.
        </p>

        <p>
          And by the way&mdash;is the choice of the word <em>buzz</em> over simply <em>phone call</em> just a product of 
          slang? I argue it’s not. Throughout
          Holden&rsquo;s journey, it&rsquo;s quite clear that the word has a deeper
          symbolic meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could, for example, represent that Holden
          &ldquo;gets&rsquo; a buzz&rdquo; from “giving other people a buzz”.
          It could also allude to the sound an insect makes,
          symbolizing that Holden&rsquo;s constant appetite for conversation
          <em>annoys</em> his companions. </p><p><em>Buzz</em> nevertheless demonstrates
          Holden&rsquo;s complex relations to his companions.
        </p>

        <!--<div class="article-box">
          <h3>takeaway</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Salinger uses <em>buzz</em> to start inner monologues and to foreshadow events. These monologues depict Holden&rsquo;s subjective interpretations, which in turn classifies the novel as coming of age.
              </li> 
              <li>
                There’s likely a symbolic meaning behind <em>buzz</em>, but it’s ambiguous.</li>
        </div>-->

        <h2>Different centuries&mdash;different styles?</h2>
        <p>
          <em>The Catcher in the Rye’</em>s qualities&mdash;its judgmental,
          exaggerated, and unconventional language and style&mdash;is not
          exclusive to 20th century literature. Delving deeper, we can in
          fact see that authors from way back have embraced this style.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example: Charles Dickens. Although his 1860s classic
          <em>Great Expectations</em> is a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism">realism movement</a> as it
          confronts societal issues among different social classes&mdash;unlike
          <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, which is arguably more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_modernism">modernistic</a> as
          it focuses on the inner feelings and emotions of
          <em>one</em> individual&mdash;the novel is in many ways comparable to
          Salinger’s.
        </p>

        
          <img src="images/great-expectations.jpeg">
          <aside>From the first chapter of <em>Great Expectations</em>. Vintage&reg;.</aside>
      

        <p>
          Most obvious is the way Dickens creates emphasis through visual changes
          to words. Just like Salinger, he italicizes them:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll <em>I</em> do with it? What&rsquo;ll <em>he</em> do
            with it? I&rsquo;ll do as much with it as <em>him</em>,&rdquo; said
            Orlick.
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;As to Pip, he&rsquo;s going up-town,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Well then, as to Old Orlick, he&rsquo;s a going
            up-town,&rdquo; retorted that worthy. &ldquo;Two can go up-town.
            Tain&rsquo;t only one wot can go up-town&rdquo;.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Again, reading the excerpt, we naturally put emphasis on <em>I</em>,
          <em>he</em>, and <em>him</em>, due to the contrast between roman and
          italic letters.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this excerpt also reveals three other stylistic&ndash;linguistic choices, two of which share motives with
          <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, it reveals a persistent use of contractions, such as
          <em>what&rsquo;ll</em> instead of “what will” and
          <em>tain&rsquo;t</em> instead of “there ain&rsquo;t.” Like
          Salinger, Dickens uses these to underscore the novel’s
          &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;&mdash;that is, by firmly establishing it as a
          verbal story.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly, both Phoebe in <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> and Orlick in
          <em>Great Expectations</em> are given the surname prefix
          <em>old</em>&mdash;as in &ldquo;old Phoebe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old
          Orlick,&rdquo; respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          As with <em>buzz</em>, we can’t confidently determine the symbolic motive behind the prefix <em>old</em>.
          We can, however, see that the prefix further underscores the
          novels&rsquo; subjective character, as well as privy relations between
          the different people in the different stories: The reader interprets
          that Holden and Phoebe &ldquo;go way back&rdquo; when Holden refers to
          his sister as &ldquo;Old Phoebe.&rdquo; In <em>Great Expectations</em>,
          the reader interprets that Orlick is, primarily, <em>old</em>&mdash;but
          also that he is whimsical. In the end, both prefixes reinforce
          character relations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note, however, that Salinger&rsquo;s and Dickens&rsquo;s
          unconventional language have different overarching motives. In
          <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, the unconventional language depicts the
          protagonist as judgmental, irrational, and preposterous. (Look no
          further than Holden&rsquo;s “Angel” rant.)
        </p>

        <p>
          On the contrary, the unconventional language of
          <em>Great Expectations</em> illustrates contrasts between
          different people:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>&ldquo;Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfounded?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em>!&rdquo; said Joe, in a very decided manner.</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself,
            remember?&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;It were understood,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;And it are
            understood.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Here, the improper verb conjugation of <em>to be</em> implies that Joe
          Gargery is of lower education, and thus of lower status, than the man
          whom he converses.</p> <p>This concept is quintessentially <em>naturalistic</em>, as
          it acknowledges and challenges contrasts between social classes. It quietly demonstrates how unfair 19th century London is.
        </p>

        <!--<div class="article-box">

          <ol>
            <li>
              <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> uses an unconventional style of writing to
            underscore Holden&rsquo;s irrational views and emotions. It&rsquo;s a modernistic text&mdash;it focuses on the
            individual and his feelings.
            </li>
            <li>
            <em>Great Expectations</em> uses an unconventional style of writing in a
            similar way (though with more irregular language), yet its overall
            ambition is to shine a light on contrasts between social classes.
            It&rsquo;s a realistic & naturalistic text&mdash;it focuses
            on the society.</li>
          </ol>
      </div>-->

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> is arguably modernistic&mdash;it&rsquo;s
          undeniably subjective and focuses on Holden&rsquo;s thoughts and
          experiences.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Salinger achieves this high level of subjectivity in mainly two ways.
          The first is through exaggerated and judgmental language: the use of
          hyperboles (e.g., &ldquo;That killed me&rdquo;), repetition (i.e.,
          repeating judgmental phrases), and careful/intentional punctuation
          (i.e., excessive use of periods).&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The other way is through an unconventional style. This style is both
          typographic (i.e., using italic type) and linguistic (i.e.,
          contraction and swearing).&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          There&rsquo;s also the symbolic word <em>buzz</em>.
          Though ambiguous in its actual meaning, its effect is profound: it is
          the catalyst for various literary devices, such as foreshadowing and
          suspension. It both progresses the story and portrays Holden.
        </p>

        <p>
          Going full circle, we can draw parallels between the stylistic choices found in
          <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> and Dickens&rsquo;s 19th century classic
          <em>Great Expectations</em>. Both novels use italic type for emphasis,
          contractions for subjectivity, and the prefix <em>old</em> for
          demonstrating human relations.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Notwithstanding their linguistic and stylistic similarities, the
          novels contrast in overall agenda: Salinger attempts to demonstrate
          the irrational feelings and thoughts of his character, while Dickens
          attempts to discuss contemporary societal issues through
          confronting&mdash;among other things&mdash;contrasts between social
          classes. Ultimately, this classifies <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> as
          modernistic, and <em>Great Expectations</em> as realistic and
          naturalistic.
